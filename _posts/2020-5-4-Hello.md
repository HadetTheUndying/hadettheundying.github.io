title: Where have I been? What's Going on?
---
Hello friends, 

I have been gone for awhile, and I apologize for that. I have been busy and just hit a big creative slump and depression. I decided the best way to get back into wanting to make things is to start writing about things I have been working on, and interesting projects I've found. 

**I have been working on:**

+ Setting up a [Discord](https://discord.gg/RPgbjJs)
+ Setting up Game Servers
+ Porting Software to PowerPC and RISC-V
+ Relearning C/C++ the **RIGHT WAY**
+ A series of lessons for people to get started using `vim`
+ Theming this blog so it's not a total eyesore(gruvbox dark coming soon...)

This is the first of many blog posts. I will try to post at least 2 times a week. Don't worry I'm going to get a decent vanity domain this week, I know the current URL is a mouthful.

Thanks for checking in.
